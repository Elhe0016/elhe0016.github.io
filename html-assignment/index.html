            About me
        </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Yumna El Hendi, I was born and raised in United Arab Emirates. I studid Information Technology; but my professional experience was in the <abbr title="Supply Chain"> SC</abbr> Field. A part of my job was to procure Multimedia services. When I was working on Multimedia Contracts, I was always impressed with the creative outcome.  I found out that Digital Graphics and Multimedia profession is more dynamic, fun and creative. It gives people the freedom to be creative and generate pieces of art out of their imagination.
